# Motion and Tween

A library written in TypeScript, exported in common JS with types, that supports motion and tweening of any sort of javascript object.

Tested with p5.js animation.

Includes the following tweening algorithms:

* Linear
* Quadratic
* Cubic
* Quartic
* Quintic
* Exponential
* Circular
* Sinusoidal

All (except linear) have the option to "EaseIn", "EaseOut", or "EaseInOut".

This library was inspired by the 2002 book "Programming Macromedia Flash MX" by Robert Penner, which is the book that inspired me to move from doing graphic design to learning Software Engineering.

That book's code was in ActionScript 1.0, which is now a dead computer language, so I updated it to support modern ES Scripts.

For feedback, bugs, improvement, or expansion ideas, email me at the email address found in the package.json file!
